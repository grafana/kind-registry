# Kind Registry

Registry for all Grafana Labs kinds.

## Maturity

This repository content and organization is at an experimental stage and likely to change in the future. 

Grafana Labs defines experimental features as follows:

> Projects and features in the Experimental stage are supported only by the Engineering teams; on-call support is not available. Documentation is either limited or not provided outside of code comments. No SLA is provided.
> 
> Experimental projects or features are primarily intended for open source engineers who want to participate in ensuring systems stability, and to gain consensus and approval for open source governance projects.
> 
> Projects and features in the Experimental phase are not meant to be used in production environments, and the risks are unknown/high.

## Usage

This registry is intented to be the source of schemas for as-code tools as [Grok](https://github.com/grafana/grok).
